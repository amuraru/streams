The <code>streams</code> Framework
=======================

The `streams` framework is a Java implementation of a variety of online machine
learning algorithms. It provides several classifier implementations as well as
algorithms for online counting or book-keeping statistics (e.g. *top-k* statistics,
and *quantiles*).

In addition to the learning algorithms, it provides a simple plugin structure to
data preprocessing and evaluation of the classifiers using a *test-then-train*
strategy.
