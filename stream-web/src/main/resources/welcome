Welcome to SciNotes
===================

*SciNotes* is a simple wiki-like system for storing notes, recording
results or centralizing logs of experiments performed with the
[streams](http://github.com/cbockermann/streams) framework. It
uses the popular [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
syntax for any notes or articles stored.
