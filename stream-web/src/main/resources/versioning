Versioning
==========

Each page stored in the *SciNotes* system is associated with a timestamp. Upon 
modification, a new copy of the page is stored, associated with the current time. 
This allows for retrieving all versions of a page/article/memo.

The orange clock icon on the upper right of each page will show a list of the 
last 10 versions of the current page.
